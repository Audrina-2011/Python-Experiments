## About Me

My name is Samira. I am a staff facilities professional. I specialize in improving energy efficiency and building enclosures. Baking and painting are my favorite hobbies. Whether I'm creating a colorful canvas or a beautifully decorated cake, they allow me to express creativity, practice mindfulness, and have fun.
